# Using Apple's AuthenticationServices APIs with Godot

This is a guide on using Sign in with Apple via the AuthenticationServices
APIs in this Godot addon. For an overview of what you can do with
AuthenticationServices, check [Apple's AuthenticationServices
Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/).

As with the rest of GodotApplePlugins, the binding surfaces the same
class names that Apple uses (prefixed with `AS`) to simplify looking
things up and finding resources online. Method names follow the Godot
naming scheme (snake_case instead of camelCase).

# Entitlements

Make sure that your iOS or Mac app have the `com.apple.developer.applesignin` entitlement.
When debugging on macOS, you need to resign the official
Godot download with this entitlement (you must download a provisioning profile that
contains the entitlement, or the APIs will fail).

## iOS

Set at Project -> Export -> iOS -> `entitlements/additional`:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
<array>
    <string>Default</string>
</array>
```

## macOS

Set the same entitlements as above (eg. when running codesign):

```sh
codesign --force --options=runtime --verbose --timestamp \
  --entitlements entitlements.plist --sign "<SIGN_ENTITY>" \
  "MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp"
```

where `entitlements.plist` contains again:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
<array>
    <string>Default</string>
</array>
```

# Quick Start

For very simple uses, you can use:

```gdscript
var auth_controller = ASAuthorizationController.new()

func _ready():
    auth_controller.authorization_completed.connect(_on_authorization_completed)
    auth_controller.authorization_failed.connect(_on_authorization_failed)

func _on_sign_in_button_pressed():
    # Request full name and email
    auth_controller.signin_with_scopes(["full_name", "email"])

func _on_authorization_completed(credential):
    if credential is ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential:
        print("User ID: ", credential.user)
        print("Email: ", credential.email)
        print("Full Name: ", credential.fullName)
    elif credential is ASPasswordCredential:
        print("User: ", credential.user)
        print("Password: ", credential.password)
```

For more advanced users, you will find that the API replicates Apple's API, and
it surfaces the various features that you expect from it.
